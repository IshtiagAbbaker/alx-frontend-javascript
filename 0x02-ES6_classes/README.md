ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced a more convenient and syntactically cleaner way to create and manage classes in JavaScript. ES6 classes provide a clear, concise syntax to create constructor functions and prototype methods, simplifying the inheritance model. With the `class` keyword, developers can define classes that encapsulate data and behavior, promoting code reuse and modularity. Additionally, ES6 classes support inheritance through the `extends` keyword, allowing one class to inherit properties and methods from another. This modern approach makes object-oriented programming in JavaScript more intuitive and aligns it with class-based structures in other programming languages, enhancing readability and maintainability of the code.
