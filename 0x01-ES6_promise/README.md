ES6 Promises, introduced in ECMAScript 2015, provide a powerful way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. A Promise represents an operation that hasn't completed yet but is expected in the future. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. When a promise is pending, it is neither resolved nor rejected. Once the operation completes, the promise either fulfills (success) or rejects (failure), triggering the associated handlers. Promises enhance code readability and maintainability by allowing developers to chain asynchronous calls using `.then()` for resolved cases and `.catch()` for handling errors, replacing the cumbersome nested callback structures known as "callback hell." Furthermore, ES6 Promises integrate seamlessly with other modern JavaScript features like async/await, providing a cleaner and more intuitive syntax for working with asynchronous code.
