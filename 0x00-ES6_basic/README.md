ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a significant update to the JavaScript language, bringing a host of new features and improvements that enhance the language's performance, readability, and maintainability. Some of the core features include let and const, which offer block-scoped variable declarations, replacing the function-scoped var. Arrow functions provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions, improving code readability and lexical binding of the this keyword. ES6 also introduces template literals, enabling multiline strings and string interpolation, and destructuring assignments, allowing for easy extraction of values from arrays and objects. Additionally, ES6 features enhanced object literals, default parameters, and the powerful class syntax for defining and extending classes. Modules, another crucial addition, facilitate better code organization and reuse by allowing the export and import of functions, objects, and primitives. Overall, ES6 represents a major leap forward for JavaScript, providing developers with modern tools to write cleaner, more efficient code.
