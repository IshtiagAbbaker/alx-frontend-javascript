TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It builds on JavaScript by adding static type definitions, which help catch errors early in the development process and enhance code readability and maintainability. TypeScript allows developers to specify types for variables, function parameters, and return values, which leads to more predictable and robust code. Additionally, it supports modern JavaScript features, including classes, modules, and async/await, making it a powerful tool for building large-scale applications. The TypeScript compiler transpiles the code to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with any environment that runs JavaScript, such as browsers and Node.js. With a strong community and widespread adoption, TypeScript has become a popular choice for developers seeking to improve the scalability and reliability of their JavaScript codebases.
