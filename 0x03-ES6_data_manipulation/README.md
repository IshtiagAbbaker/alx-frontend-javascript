ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several powerful features for data manipulation in JavaScript, enhancing both the language's functionality and developer experience. One of the most notable additions is the introduction of new data structures such as `Map` and `Set`. `Map` provides a key-value store, allowing more flexible handling of key types compared to traditional objects, while `Set` offers a collection of unique values, eliminating duplicates effortlessly.

Additionally, ES6 introduced the `spread` operator (`...`), which enables the expansion of arrays and objects, facilitating easier merging and copying. The `rest` parameter, also represented by `...`, allows for the representation of an indefinite number of arguments as an array, simplifying function definitions and enhancing flexibility.

Array manipulation became more intuitive with methods like `Array.from()`, which creates arrays from array-like or iterable objects, and `Array.of()`, which creates arrays with a variable number of arguments. Enhanced iteration capabilities were also introduced through the `for...of` loop, providing a more readable and concise way to loop over iterable objects.

Moreover, ES6 brought improvements to asynchronous data handling with Promises, offering a cleaner and more manageable approach to asynchronous operations compared to traditional callback functions. Promises, combined with the introduction of async/await in later versions, revolutionized how asynchronous code is written and maintained, making it more readable and easier to debug.

Overall, ES6 significantly advanced data manipulation in JavaScript, making the language more robust, expressive, and developer-friendly.
